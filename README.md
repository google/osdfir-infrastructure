# OSDFIR Infrastructure

OSDFIR Infrastructure helps setup Open Source
Digital Forensics tools to Kubernetes clusters using Helm.

Currently, OSDFIR Infrastructure supports the deployment and integration of the following tools:

* [dfTimewolf](https://github.com/log2timeline/dftimewolf) for orchestrating forensic collection, processing and data export, helping pass data between tools using recipes (e.g. importing processed Plaso files from Turbinia into Timesketch)
* [Timesketch](https://github.com/google/timesketch) for collaborative forensic timeline analysis featuring analyzers to help identitify patterns in data, support for Plaso, JSONL, or CSV file imports, and built-in integrations to tools such as:
  * [DFIQ](https://dfiq.org/) for digital forensics investigative questions and the approaches to answering them
  * [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) for detection and hunting rules to run across timelines
  * [Unfurl](https://github.com/obsidianforensics/unfurl) for graph analysis of URLs
* [Turbinia](https://github.com/google/turbinia) for automating processing of forensic evidence at scale helping find prevelant badness and includes built-in integrations to many tools such as:
  * [Container Explorer](https://github.com/google/container-explorer) for container level processing
  * [Docker Explorer](https://github.com/google/docker-explorer) for docker container level processing
  * [Fraken](https://github.com/google/turbinia/tree/master/tools/fraken) for multi-threaded yara scanning
  * [Libcloudforensics](https://github.com/google/cloud-forensics-utils/) for mounting evidence from cloud platforms
  * [Plaso](https://github.com/log2timeline/plaso) (and related projects such as dfVFS, libyal) for extracting data from a variety of sources into a correlated super timeline
* [Yeti](https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti) for DFIR and threat intelligence tracking, enabling responders to store and analyze CTI (observables, TTPs, campaigns, etc.) from internal and external systems and integrates with Timesketch

These tools can be used independently as well by following the documentation on the tool's repository or by installing a tool specific Helm chart which includes any built-in integrations.

## Installing the Charts

To get started, ensure you have [Helm](https://helm.sh) installed and are authenticated to your Kubernetes cluster.
> **IMPORTANT**: Helm charts are currently undergoing compatibility testing for AWS and Azure

Once complete, add the repo containing the Helm charts as follows:

```console
helm repo add osdfir-charts https://google.github.io/osdfir-infrastructure
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.
You can then run `helm search repo osdfir-charts` to see the available charts.

To install the OSDFIR Infrastructure chart using a release name of `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release osdfir-charts/osdfir-infrastructure
```

> **Note**: The default configuration of the Helm chart installs it within your cluster for internal access. To enable external access, follow the instructions provided in the Helm chart's README.

To uninstall the chart:

```console
helm uninstall my-release
```
