# OSDFIR Infrastructure

OSDFIR Infrastructure helps setup Open Source
Digital Forensics tools to Kubernetes clusters using Helm.

Currently, OSDFIR Infrastructure supports the deployment and integration of the following tools:

* [Timesketch](https://github.com/google/timesketch)
* [Turbinia](https://github.com/google/turbinia)
* [dfTimewolf](https://github.com/log2timeline/dftimewolf)

## Installing the Charts

To get started, ensure you have [Helm](https://helm.sh) installed and are authenticated to your Kubernetes cluster, then using a release name of your choice, such as `my-release`, run:

```console
helm install my-release oci://us-docker.pkg.dev/osdfir-registry/osdfir-charts/osdfir-infrastructure
```

The command deploys OSDFIR Infrastructure on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. See the [GKE Installations](charts/osdfir-infrastructure/README.md) section for installing to GCP environments or to quickly get started with a local cluster, see [minikube install docs](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
